rails generate scaffold (when the model already exists)

Even though you already have a model, you can still generate the necessary controller and migration files by using the rails generate option. If you run rails generate -h you can see all of the options available to you.

Rails:
  controller
  generator
  helper
  integration_test
  mailer
  migration
  model
  observer
  performance_test
  plugin
  resource
  scaffold
  scaffold_controller
  session_migration
  stylesheets

If you'd like to generate a controller scaffold for your model, see scaffold_controller. Just for clarity, here's the description on that:

Stubs out a scaffolded controller and its views. Pass the model name, either CamelCased or under_scored, and a list of views as arguments. The controller name is retrieved as a pluralized version of the model name.

To create a controller within a module, specify the model name as a path like 'parent_module/controller_name'.

This generates a controller class in app/controllers and invokes helper, template engine and test framework generators.
To create your resource, you'd use the resource generator, and to create a migration, you can also see the migration generator (see, there's a pattern to all of this madness). These provide options to create the missing files to build a resource. Alternatively you can just run rails generate scaffold with the --skip option to skip any files which exist.
