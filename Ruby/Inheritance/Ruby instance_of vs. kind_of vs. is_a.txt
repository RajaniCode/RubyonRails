Ruby: kind_of? vs. instance_of? vs. is_a?

kind_of? and is_a? are synonymous. instance_of? is different from the other two in that it only returns true if the object is an instance of that exact class, not a subclass.

Example: 5.is_a? Integer and 5.kind_of? Integer return true because 5 is a Fixnum and Fixnum is a subclass of Integer. However 5.instance_of? Integer returns false.
